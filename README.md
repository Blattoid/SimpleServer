# SimpleServer

It uses a simple TCP Listener to interact over a network. Once connected it optionally asks for a password or just brings you to the menu. This option in the config file. At the moment you can't do too much; there is a 8-Ball simulator and a list drives command, which spits out basic information about the attached volumes on the server. I will probably add more commands over time, but this is all there is for now. As always, pre-compiled binaries can be found in the Executables folder.
